In each lab folder (`Lab_1`, `Lab_2`, etc.), you'll find subfolders corresponding to different programming languages (Java, Python, C++, etc.). Within these language-specific folders are the solutions to the respective lab exercises.

## Languages Used

Solutions are provided in various programming languages to cater to different preferences and educational needs. The languages currently supported include:

- Java
- Python
- C++

Feel free to contribute solutions in other languages as well, provided they adhere to the conventions and standards of object-oriented programming.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged. If you have additional solutions or improvements to existing ones, please submit a pull request. When contributing, follow these guidelines:

- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices for object-oriented programming.
- Add your solutions to the appropriate folder based on the lab and programming language.
- Provide clear explanations or comments in your code to aid understanding.
- If adding a solution in a new programming language, ensure it aligns with the OOP principles of that language.
